        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
          I used a XGBoost decision tree model that analyzed various
          inputs to project a salary for every player. By projecting each
          salary in terms of percentage of the salary cap, we were able
          to account for increasing caps and inflation. These projections
          were considered accurate if they fell within a 1% range from
          the actual salary. Based on this metric, our model achieved an
          accuracy of just over 83% (for more detail, see the graphs at
          the top).</p>
          <p>By putting this data into Tableau, we were able to create an
          automated player card which displays the projected salary as
          well as offensive and defensive ratings for each player.</p>
